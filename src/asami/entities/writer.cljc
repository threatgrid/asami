;; internal generated properties:
;; :tg/rest List structure
;; :tg/owns References sub entities
;; :tg/entity When true, then indicates a top level entity

;; The following 2 attributes may vary according to the database.
;; e.g. Datomic appends -s -l -d etc to these attributes for different datatypes
;; Asami uses these names without modification:
;; :tg/first Indicates a list member by position. Returned by node/data-attribute
;; :tg/contains Shortcut to list members. Returned by node/container-attribute

;; The following are graph nodes with special meaning:
;; :tg/emtpty-list A list without entries
;; :tg/nil a nil value


;; provides dynamic scope of the current contents of the graph
;; This approach has been adopted to avoid redundantly passing the graph down the callstack
